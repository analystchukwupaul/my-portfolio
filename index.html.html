            I collected and clean the sales data, performed exploratory analysis,And
            <br>built an interactive dashboard that highlights key sales KPI,trends,
            <br> and performance breakdowns by making the dashboard user-friendly And
            <br>insightful for non-technical stakeholders.

            <br>for user-driven filtering to support dynamic analysis by the marketing
            <br> and sales teams.
